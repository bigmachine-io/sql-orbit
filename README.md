# The Code for SQL in Orbit

Hi there - if you're here you've (hopefully) purchased [SQL in Orbit](https://sql.bigmachine.io), a video production I made that introduces people to the art of SQL and working with data. 

This repository has the _final_ code, _without_ the data because it's simply too big. There are links in the video itself for access to that.

## Issues

See something that doesn't sound correct? A bug somewhere? **I'm counting on it**! As much as I've been through these results, there's always something I miss OR, more likely, that I could have done better. Please feel free to use the issues to tell me all about it!
